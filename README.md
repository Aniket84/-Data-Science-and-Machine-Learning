# Data Science

The data science repository has the simple data science projects that helps to boost the knowladge and skills on the data science using some freely availabe datasets.

### Requirements 

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - I am using the anaconda distribution for python which comes with all the required scientific library built-in. Anaconda Distibution can be freely downloaded from [Here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
* [Numpy](www.numpy.org)- NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software))
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) -Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib)
